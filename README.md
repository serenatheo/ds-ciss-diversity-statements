This script performs a comprehensive analysis of Fortune 500 companies' websites to find information related to international workers, visas, and sponsorships. It enhances this information using the OpenAI API and scrapes LinkedIn for job postings to detect relevant keywords. The results are saved in both Excel and PDF formats. The script starts by importing necessary libraries: `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, `pandas` for data manipulation, `openai` for interacting with the OpenAI API, `weasyprint` for generating PDF files, `math` for mathematical operations, and `time` for controlling the timing of web requests.

The OpenAI API key is set up to enable interaction with the OpenAI service. The script then reads an Excel file containing the names and URLs of Fortune 500 companies into a DataFrame. A list of relevant keywords related to international employment and visas is defined to search for this information on the company websites. Headers are set up to mimic a browser request to avoid being blocked by websites.

A function `check_company_website` is defined to search each company's website for the specified keywords. This function attempts to fetch the website, parses its content, and searches for the keywords in the text and hyperlinks. If the website cannot be accessed, an error message is printed.

Another function `scrape_linkedin_jobs` is defined to scrape LinkedIn for job postings for each company. It constructs URLs to access LinkedIn's job search API, iterates through the search results, and extracts job details, including company name, job title, seniority level, and checks for the presence of keywords in the job descriptions.

The script then iterates through the first ten companies in the Excel file. For each company, it fixes any incorrect URL formats, prints a message indicating which company is being checked, and calls the `check_company_website` function. It uses the OpenAI API to generate a text summary of what the company's career website says about international candidates and searches this generated text for the relevant keywords. 

Finally, it calls the `scrape_linkedin_jobs` function to gather job details from LinkedIn. The results, including found links, generated text, and job details, are stored in a DataFrame. This DataFrame is saved to a new Excel file and converted to a PDF for reporting purposes. The script prints a message indicating that the results have been saved. The entire process combines web scraping, API interaction, and data manipulation to gather and organize information about international employment opportunities at major companies.
